Feature Selection with Nearest Neighbor
Given the fact that all the data sets have a best feature subset of 3, I limited the search space to 3 features. Once the algorithm finds the best 3 features, it stops the search as it is unlikely it'll find a better subset. This is only meant to speed up testing and the if statement can be commented out. This modification really only affects forwardSelection.


Wanted to submit before 11:59 so I didn't have enough time to add a conclusion (my own fault) but I wanted to add that had I spent more time on this I might have been able to get backwards elimination to work. Maybe. Either way enjoy your break, cheers.
